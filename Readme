Classes

  Net
  Neuron
  Connection

  Layer (Is not a class but a type of vector<neuron>)


Net is the top layer class containing the neural net,
composed of three or more layers that contains the neurons.
Each neuron contains a connection class that connects it to other neurons.


Hirearchy goes like

Net -> Neuron -> Connection
